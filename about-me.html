    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <h2 class="header">The Villager</h2>

      <p>
        At the edge of the Chetambe Hills, you feel like you are at the edge of
        the world. Looking down, you see the River Nzoia meandering through the
        hills to a steep vertical river bed, now known as the Nabuyole Falls. To
        the east, you can see the Nandi Escarpment in the neighboring county, a
        county known for its endless fields of tea. When the paper factory was
        here, a pine forest took over the westward slopes. Of course, I know
        this is not the etdge of Earth, but this place at the edge of my village
        still takes my breath away. This is Webuye in Bungoma County. When I was
        last standing there, I had just been admitted to KenSAP (Kenya Scholar
        Access Program). I sat on the cliffs, observing daily life below me and
        reminiscing about how far I had come. It was the onset of the rainy
        season and the scent of guava trees filled the air with the fragrance of
        the ripe fruits. Monkeys were chattering boisterously while jumping from
        tree to tree. Brown mushrooms sprouted from the spongy, moist grounds.
        As a child, we found out the hard way which ones made for a nice
        delicacy or a day of stomach pains. As I walk along the hills, I see an
        old cargo train spewing smoke and slowly crawling toward the Uganda
        border. In the distance, people without money chased the train along the
        tracks for the chance to jump onto the sides for a free ride. On the
        plains below, I noticed the deserted paper factory, now only used for
        criminal activity and drug abuse. This factory had once been the source
        of livelihood for the vast majority of Webuye's residents. Before the
        factory, this village was a forest and I fear that its closing down will
        mean the fall of Webuye. In the bush, behind me on the cliffs, some
        whispers bring me back from my memories. “Ni uria watira masomo vilayi.”
        (He is the one who got everything in school). I turn around and see
        children staring at me and I give them some words of wisdom about doing
        well in school. 3 Nowadays, with the factory closed, most families
        struggle to make ends meet by selling crops or quarrying stones from the
        Chetambe Hills. My father used to work casual jobs like this to make
        ends meet until his demise. I remember the day he died like it was
        yesterday. Earlier that month, my father was falsely diagnosed with
        tuberculosis. We later found out he died of a preventable illness. I was
        six years old and saw no hope in the future. We were riddled with debt
        from his medical bills.

        When he died, I was forced to switch schools to a local public primary
        school, where education was free. We had to move into one of the
        abandoned paper factory rooms, surrounded by poverty and lost hope. But
        I maintained hope. My mother always told me, “education is the only way
        out of poverty.” But education was not easy here. We walked three
        kilometers to a dilapidated school that did not have enough books,
        desks, or teachers to support us. After school, we fetched water and
        firewood, weeded the garden, swung our jembes (garden hoe) to dig holes,
        and found work at the quarry. Yet I always remembered that education was
        our only chance. Life was difficult but school was simple. I found
        myself in harmony with my academics. I developed a special interest for
        Mathematics that still sticks with me today. I fell in love with
        learning how numbers ruled the world around me and I started to explore
        the world around me in a scientific manner. The hills became
        opportunities to calculate the rate of flowing water, the garden became
        a place for imagining the laws behind biological form, and our expenses
        became a way for me to plan family finances. When my primary school
        results were released, it was a frenzied celebration for the whole
        village.

        I was selected to join Alliance High School, hundreds of kilometers away
        from Webuye. The villagers were happy; one of their own had a chance to
        bring back the fortunes of the distant land. They pooled together enough
        money to support my first year at Alliance High School and a few weeks
        later, my mother took me to high school. The journey from home to
        Alliance cut through seventeen counties. We arrived at Alliance High
        School almost a day after departing Webuye. I was thrilled to be
        attending Kenya’s best high school, a school that would open up a whole
        new world of possibilities for a better future. Almost immediately, I
        found myself facing a whole new set of difficulties adjusting to
        Alliance but as I walked through those gates, I felt accomplished - like
        I had found a new edge of the world. I left my mother at the gate, but
        not before she reminded me that education was our hope for a better
        future

        After graduating from Allince High School, I applied and got in to the
        Kenya SCholar Access Program, KenSAP, where I applied to college and got
        in.

        When KenSAP asked me if I was willing to join the famous Moringa school,
        I quickly accepted the offer. I was extremely passionate about enrolling
        since this would help me be at par with other freshmen in my college who
        have backgrounds in IT. Since I intend to persue something in the line
        of Computer Technology, Moringa School and its rigorous curriculum was
        the best place to start. At Moringa school, I intend to harness the
        opportunity to learn how to learn and influence the next generation of
        coders. I also am ready to work hard to make coding a source of income
        in my future years. Moreover, staying at home for the next 6 months
        would be boring, and the social interaction and collaboration at Moringa
        school would do my social life great.

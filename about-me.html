          At the edge of the Chetambe Hills, you feel like you are at the edge
          of the world. Looking down, you see the River Nzoia meandering through
          the hills to a steep vertical river bed, now known as the Nabuyole
          Falls. To the east, you can see the Nandi Escarpment in the
          neighboring county, a county known for its endless fields of tea. When
          the paper factory was here, a pine forest took over the westward
          slopes. Of course, I know this is not the etdge of Earth, but this
          place at the edge of my village still takes my breath away. This is
          Webuye in Bungoma County.

        When I was last standing there, I had just been admitted to KenSAP
        (Kenya Scholar Access Program). I sat on the cliffs, observing daily
        life below me and reminiscing about how far I had come. It was the onset
        of the rainy season and the scent of guava trees filled the air with the
        fragrance of the ripe fruits. Monkeys were chattering boisterously while
        jumping from tree to tree. Brown mushrooms sprouted from the spongy,
        moist grounds. As a child, we found out the hard way which ones made for
        a nice delicacy or a day of stomach pains. As I walk along the hills, I
        see an old cargo train spewing smoke and slowly crawling toward the
        Uganda border. In the distance, people without money chased the train
        along the tracks for the chance to jump onto the sides for a free ride.

        I was raised in Nabuyole Village in Webuye and lived there from my birth
        date <span class="date"> 2002 to 2019 </span>when we moved to Kikuyu. I
        am second in a family of 4 children and a mother.

        I started school in 2006 aged 4 at
        <span class="name"> Saint Peters Academy </span>where I did 3 years of
        pre school and class 1, in the 8-4-4 system. I then transferred school
        to <span class="name"> Webuye AC primary School </span> where I schooled
        for seven years,<span class="date"> from 2010 to 2016 </span>when I did
        my <span class="acronym"> KCPE.</span>

        I was selected to <span class="name">Alliance High School</span> join in

        After graduating from Allince High School, I applied and got in to the
        Kenya SCholar Access Program, KenSAP, where I applied to college and got
        in.

        When KenSAP asked me if I was willing to join the famous Moringa school,
        I quickly accepted the offer. I was extremely passionate about enrolling
        since this would help me be at par with other freshmen in my college who
        have backgrounds in IT. Since I intend to persue something in the line
        of Computer Technology, Moringa School and its rigorous curriculum was
        the best place to start. At Moringa school, I intend to harness the
        opportunity to learn how to learn and influence the next generation of
        coders. I also am ready to work hard to make coding a source of income
        in my future years. Moreover, staying at home for the next 6 months
        would be boring, and the social interaction and collaboration at Moringa
        school would do my social life great.

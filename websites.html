    <h1>Ahona's websites</h1>
    <p></p>
    <p>
      My name is John Yoshi Ahona, a student of Moringa school taking web
      development. Below is a list of websites I have created in my first week
      at Moringa school:
    </p>
    <h2>List of websites</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <h3><a href="math-web/chess.html"> My favorite game</a></h3>
      </li>
      <p>See the game I love the most, chess!</p>
      <p>
        I used html, css and bootstrap to create it. In the website, I have
        briefly introduced the game and went on to documnt steps to mastering
        the war of the minds!
      </p>
      <li>
        <h3><a href="math-web/index.html"> Mathematics</a></h3>
      </li>
      <p>
        Check out 3 legends of math who I like. These are the just but a few
        founders of this discipline which I call "The theory of everything!!"
      </p>
      <p>
        Created using html and bootstrap. In it there is a link to the website
        about chess.
      </p>

        <h3><a href="Travels/trails.html"> Travel Agencies</a></h3>
      </li>
      <p>
        I created this website for a travel company. It contains various tourist
        destinations.
      </p>
      <p>Created using html, css and the bootstrap framework.</p>

      <span class="key">mathematics</span> is the <em>language of the gods!</em>
    </p>
    <p>
      It is the medium through which the laws of nature are written. I dare say,
      Each and every thing we know from the physical sciences to biological
      sciences to the arts(including language), can be broken down to some kind
      of <span class="key"><span class="key">mathematics</span></span
      >. But it is of course easier to express the physical sciences in their
      pure mathematical form, in comparison to language. But fact remains,
      <span class="key"><span class="key">mathematics</span></span> is the basic
      structure of everythin, the purest of knowledge and phylosophy.
    </p>
    <p>
      In this spirit it is easy to forgive
      <span class="auth">Pythagoras</span> for his perception of numbers as
      mystical.

      <span class="auth">Pythagoras</span>
      > (l.c. 571- c. 497 BCE) was a <span class="nat">Greek </span> philosopher
      whose teachings emphasized the immortality and transmigration of the soul
      (reincarnation), virtuous, humane behavior toward all living things, and
      the concept of “number” as truth in that
      <span class="key"><span class="key">mathematics</span></span> not only
      cleared the mind but allowed for an objective comprehension of reality. He
      is best known in the modern day for the Pythagorean Theorem, a
      mathematical formula which states that the square of the hypotenuse of a
      right triangle is equal to the sum of the squares on the other two sides.
      This formula has been applied to measuring distance and space as, for
      example, in planning and executing the construction of a building.
      Although attributed to <span class="auth">Pythagoras</span> by ancient
      writers, modern scholars cite evidence from
      <span class="nat">Babylonian </span> texts, written some time before
      <span class="auth">Pythagoras</span>
      >, which discuss the same formula or, at least, one very similar. Almost
      nothing is known of
      <span class="auth">Pythagoras</span>' life even though later writers (such
      as <span class="name">Diogenes Laertius</span>, l. c.180-240 CE) attempted
      to put together biographies based on stories and fragments from earlier
      works. Laertius' biography of <span class="auth">Pythagoras</span>is the
      most complete but, unfortunately, the author never cites the sources he
      drew from and so it is impossible to corroborate many of his claims. THE
      DIFFICULTY IN ANY DISCUSSION OF <span class="auth">Pythagoras</span>IS TO
      SEPARATE THE ACTUAL MAN & HIS TEACHINGS FROM THE MYTHOLOGY WHICH
      SURROUNDED HIM. <span class="auth">Pythagoras</span>' influence on later
      philosophers, and the development of Greek philosophy generally, was
      enormous. Plato (l. c. 428/427-348/347 BCE) references
      <span class="auth">Pythagoras</span> in a number of his works and
      Pythagorean thought, as understood and relayed by other ancient writers,
      is the underlying form of Plato's philosophy. Plato's famous student
      Aristotle (l. 384-322 BCE) also incorporated Pythagorean teachings into
      his own thought and Aristotle's works would influence philosophers, poets,
      and theologians (among many others) from his time through the Middle Ages
      (c. 476-1500 CE) and into the modern day. Although
      <span class="auth">Pythagoras</span>remains a mysterious figure in
      antiquity, therefore, he also stands as one of the most significant in the
      development of philosophical and religious thought.
